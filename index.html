<h1>Dylan Tuten</h1>
<p>Creator of many things, most of which can be found on the internet.<br>
<br>There currently is no curated list of concepts I have conjured into corporeal form with my creativity, and I refuse to craft one now.
<br>Instead, here is a list of pseudonyms I am known to frequently make use of:</p>
<p>Dylan Tuten (as a programmer/as a college student),<br>Dylan M. Tuten (as an author),<br>the Elephants (a music "group" (it's just me)),<br>Maturin<br>
