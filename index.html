<h1>Dylan Tuten</h1>
<h2>Game Developer &amp; Author</h2>
<p>I'm currently writing a novel, making a game with my friend Teagan, and occasionally doing small game jams! Check this page later, I'm busy with school right now and don't have much to show off (yet)</p>
<p>I don't use social media! Don't trust any account that claims to be me on the internet. Here are the <em>only</em> other places you can find me besides the site you're on now:</p>
